The idea is also very simple:
* You may create bins with up to 10k bytes, which is equivalent to 10,000 characters in most cases.
* You only need to pay the necessary GAS to send the transaction. The service itself is free.
* Your content stays there forever.
* It uses Metamask to send transactions and interact with the smart contract.
* The code has been verified on Etherscan.io:  https://etherscan.io/address/0x235c807707f453befc5b077de3295e278d223bdf#code 

That's it! I have no idea if anyone will use it. Anyway, it was a fun journey.

As for the tech, it's Solidity, Javascript, Bootstrap and [gasmon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gasmon), nothing fancy.
It works and I'm happy with it!
